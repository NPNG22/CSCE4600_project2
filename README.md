## Description

For this project I have added 5 different commands:

1. echo - print out the argument
2. ls - list everything in the directory
3. mkdir - make a new directory
4. pwd - print current directory
5. touch - to create a file and do various other task with it

## Steps

To run the shell: go run main.go
